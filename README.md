*Quantification of reads at defined positions in custom input sequences.*


Given a gene fusion or splicing junction of interest, this tool can quantify RNA-seq reads 
supporting the breakpoint (junction) by quantifying reads that map to the breakpoint (junction reads) and
read pairs that span the breakpoint (spanning pairs).

## Dependencies

 - python
 - STARR (for read mapping)

## Installation

```
git clone git@gitlab.rlp.net:tron/easyquant.git
```

## Usage example


```
python <script> <args>
```
